# Air quality getting better
India has implemented measures to control pollution from vehicles. The country has transitioned to Bharat Stage (BS) VI vehicle emission standards, which contain new fuel specifications and standards for commercial gasoline and diesel to support the advanced emission control technologies that automakers are incorporating in BS VI vehicles1. This started in 2020 April. Along with this, they have started to make cities green these might be reasons behind improving the air quality of cities in India.
In the Chart below we can see the air quality of Delhi from Jan 2019 to Dec 2023 and you can assume that each peak is a new year i.e. next Jan. So, with that air quality is worst in 2019 but it gets the best result in 2020 probably because of a pandemic but with 2021 it peaks up and the trend of a slight improvement in air quality can be seen every year from then. This pattern can be seen in other countries of India.
